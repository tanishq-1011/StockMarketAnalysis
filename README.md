# Stock Market Analysis & Prediction

This project involves analyzing historical stock market data to provide insights and make predictions using time series analysis techniques. We utilized various data analysis and machine learning methods to forecast stock prices and visualize key market trends.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we:
- **Analyzed historical stock market data** to understand past trends and market behavior.
- **Applied time series analysis** using the ARIMA model to predict future stock prices.
- **Visualized the data** with comprehensive plots, highlighting patterns and trends for better insight into market fluctuations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and wrangling stock data for effective analysis.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting stock prices using the ARIMA model.
- **Visualization**: Using Seaborn and Tableau to create detailed plots, providing clear insights into stock trends and movements.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key insights into market conditions through statistical summaries and visual plots.


## 📊 Visualization
- **Seaborn** was used for visualizing data trends and distributions in Python.
- **Tableau** was employed for creating interactive dashboards to explore stock price fluctuations over time.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **ARIMA**: Time series forecasting model.
- **Seaborn**: Visualization library for detailed data plots.
- **Tableau**: For interactive and comprehensive data visualizations.
